                <ol>
                    <li>Question One - Fair Use is a legal doctrine that allows limited use of copyrighted material
                        without requiring permission from the rights holders. It enables educators, researchers, and
                        other creators to use portions of copyrighted works for purposes such as criticism, comment,
                        news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research, provided that such use meets certain
                        criteria.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Question Two- Purpose and character of use, nature of the copyrighted work, amount and
                        substantiality, and effect on the market.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Question Three - Fair use benefits instructional designers by allowing them to incorporate
                        various copyrighted materials—such as texts, images, videos, and music—into their course
                        materials without needing explicit permission. This enables them to create richer, more engaging
                        educational experiences, support critical thinking, and foster discussions while promoting
                        diverse viewpoints.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Question Four - Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that provides free licenses and
                        public domain tools for creators to share their works legally. Instructional designers can use
                        Creative Commons-licensed materials to enhance their course content by remixing, adapting, and
                        incorporating these resources into their materials, thus saving time and fostering
                        collaboration.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Question Five - A CC BY license (Attribution) allows others to use, distribute, and adapt the
                        work for any purpose, including commercial use, as long as the original creator is credited. In
                        contrast, a CC BY-NC license (Attribution-NonCommercial) permits use and adaptation of the work
                        but only for non-commercial purposes, requiring the original creator to be credited as well.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Question Six - The ShareAlike (SA) condition requires that if instructional designers adapt or
                        remix a Creative Commons-licensed work with the ShareAlike condition, they must distribute their
                        resulting work under the same or a compatible license. This ensures that adaptations remain
                        accessible under similar terms, promoting continued sharing and collaboration.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Question Seven - The key difference between "Attribution" (CC BY) and "NonCommercial" (CC BY-NC)
                        licenses lies in the permission for commercial use. The CC BY license allows for both commercial
                        and non-commercial use as long as credit is given to the original creator, making it more
                        flexible for instructional designers who might sell their materials. In contrast, the CC BY-NC
                        license restricts use to non-commercial purposes only, which could limit the ability to use the
                        content in paid courses or materials.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Question Eight - Public domain resources are works that are no longer under copyright
                        protection, meaning they can be freely used, modified, and distributed without permission or
                        payment. Instructional designers can use public domain resources to create educational
                        materials, enhancing their content with historical texts, images, and other resources without
                        legal restrictions.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Question Nine - Any two examples you find are perfect!</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Question Ten - Copyright Status: Public domain resources are not protected by copyright and can
                        be used freely without restriction, while Creative Commons resources are still under copyright
                        but offer specific permissions for use and adaptation based on the chosen license. Usage Rights:
                        Public domain works can be used for any purpose without crediting the original creator, whereas
                        Creative Commons resources typically require attribution to the creator and may have additional
                        conditions (such as non-commercial use or share-alike).</li>

                <p>Use this answer key more as a guideline! A lot of the questions were open ended and creating and
                    sharing your opinions is valid!

                <p>At its core, website accessibility ensures everyone is able to
                    effectively use and interact with online content. By making websites accessible,
                    we are able to create inclusive digital environemnts where
                    everyone is able to access necessary information, products, and services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from being good practice, accessibility is also a legal requirement
                    in many different countries. For instance, in the United States, the
                    Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires digital spaces to be accessible
                    to those with disabilities, similar to how physical public spaces must
                    accomodate accessibility needs. The ADA requires businesses, Educational
                    institutions, and governemnt websites to follow certain guidelines
                    and present accessible content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To guide website creators, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG),
                    created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) were made to outline best
                    practices for creating accessible websites. The WCAG focuses on four key
                    concepts, they are as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Perceivable: Content must be presented in ways users can perceive,
                        for example providing alternative text for images.
                    </li>
                    <li>Operable: All users should be able to effectively interact with and
                        navigate the website, regardless of any assistive technology used.
                    </li>
                    <li>Understandable: Information and operation of the User Interface
                        should be clear and easy to comprehend.
                    </li>
                    <li>Robust: Content should be adaptable with different assistive
                        technologies.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Adhering to both the ADA and WCAG standards, we can guarantee 
                    our websites are inclusive and legally complient, preventing discrimination 
                    and promoting equal access.

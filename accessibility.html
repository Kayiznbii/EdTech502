                    <p>At its core, website accessibility ensures everyone is able to
                        effectively use and interact with online content. By making websites accessible,
                        we are able to create inclusive digital environemnts where
                        everyone is able to access necessary information, products, and services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from being good practice, accessibility is also a legal requirement
                        in many different countries. For instance, in the United States, the
                        Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires digital spaces to be accessible
                        to those with disabilities, similar to how physical public spaces must
                        accomodate accessibility needs. The ADA requires businesses, Educational
                        institutions, and governemnt websites to follow certain guidelines
                        and present accessible content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To guide website creators, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG),
                        created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) were made to outline best
                        practices for creating accessible websites. The WCAG focuses on four key
                        concepts, they are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Perceivable: Content must be presented in ways users can perceive,
                            for example providing alternative text for images.
                        </li>
                        <li>Operable: All users should be able to effectively interact with and
                            navigate the website, regardless of any assistive technology used.
                        </li>
                        <li>Understandable: Information and operation of the User Interface
                            should be clear and easy to comprehend.
                        </li>
                        <li>Robust: Content should be adaptable with different assistive
                            technologies.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Adhering to both the ADA and WCAG standards, we can guarantee
                        our websites are inclusive and legally complient, preventing discrimination
                        and promoting equal access.

                        Unfortunately there still needs to be significant development and improvement for this type of
                        software to allow for more accessibility, but the concept is fascinating and I believe this
